## Introduction
Step Parents Unite is a blog website designed for step families to chat and support
each other with the ups and downs of either just step children or blended families.
Being a parent to your own biological children can be tough, but the maze of being a step parent is much
more difficult so I was hoping this page could bridge this gap.
